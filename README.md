## Examination Procedure

The examination process consists of two parts - a body of work and a face-to-face interview.

### Submitting a body of Work

A candidate must submit a body of work for review which defines their basic competence in FIWARE.

-   Each item from the body of work should be available publicly and linked to the online presence of the candidate.
-   If the body of work is not public, the examiners must sign a non-disclosure agreement, and the discussion of the
    body-of-work may take place _in camera_.
-   The examiners will review the body of work prior to the examination and decide if it is sufficient for the candidate
    to proceed. If it is not judged to be sufficient, amendments/additions will be requested prior to the examination

### Face-to-Face Interview

The face-to-face examination will consist of the following parts:

-   Discussion of the body-of-work
-   Discussion on NGSI interfaces
-   Discussion on the FIWARE Catalogue
-   Discussion on correct Architecture of a “Powered by FIWARE” solutions/platform
-   Discussion on “FIWARE-ready” technologies
